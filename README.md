# CS 3060

This repository contains my Java programming assignments for the course CS 3060: Object Oriented Programming with C++.

CS 3060 had three principal goals: 1) to learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, 2) to gain skill and proficiency in using the C++ programming language, 3) to exercise the C++ language in implementing a moderate sized software system designed with objects.

I completed this course at UCCS in May 2021. The title of each C++ file gives an overview of each program. A detailed description can also be found at the top of each program file.
